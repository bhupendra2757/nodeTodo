Today we are going to set up a server using Node.js and create simple API endpoints to get you started in your web backend journey.
1. Setup Node.js on your computer
  Go to the website above and download the LTS version of Node.js and install it on your computer.
2. Check Node.js and NPM version
  node -v
  npm -v
3. Initial a new project
  Now that you have completed the setup for Node.js. Time to get started. Go to an empty directory and create an index.js file.
4. Set up your Node.js server
  npm init
  To initialize package.json.
  npm i express
  To install express to do the job for you.
  and initialize server setup.
5. Define the schema for your data in the models > todo.js
6. Define the controller for your to-do CRUD in the controllers > todoController.js
   Starting from CRUD then apply CRUD operation, create API.
7. Define the route name for the frontend client to call the APIs in the routes > route.js
8. Finally, you have arrived at the last step. Add what you have created into the index.js file and re-run your node server.

This is only the backend for Todo app using Node.js.
